Let's play a game. You must have a conversation about $topic with your partner. Your first turn must start and end with words that begin with the letter $letter. The reply of your partner must be similar, with the letter that comes after $letter in the alphabet. Then it's your turn again with the next letter, and so on. You'll do it for $nturns turns. Always start your utterance with I SAY: and then give your answer. If you break the rules, you lose.
