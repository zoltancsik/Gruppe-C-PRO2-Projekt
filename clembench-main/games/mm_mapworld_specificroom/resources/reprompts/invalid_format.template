Please only give your answer in the provided format so I can understand it. The format is {"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. If we have found a $GOAL$, replace <action> with "DONE" instead. What should we do?
