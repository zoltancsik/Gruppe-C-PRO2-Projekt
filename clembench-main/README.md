### Updates
(February 2024): We have updated the framework code. If you have written games using the initial release version, see [this guide](docs/howto_update_to_v1.md) on how to update your game.

# clembench: A Framework for the Systematic Evaluation of Chat-Optimized Language Models as Conversational Agents

The cLLM (chat-optimized Large Language Model, "clem") framework tests such models' ability to engage in games – rule-constituted activities played using language.
The framework is a systematic way of probing for the situated language understanding of language using agents.

This repository contains the code for setting up the framework and implements a number of games that are further discussed in
